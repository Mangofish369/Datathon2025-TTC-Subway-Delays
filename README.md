# Datathon2025-TTC-Subway-Delays
Project: 00052 Improving Commuter Awareness in Subway Delays

A machine learning algorthim used to predict if TTC delay times will be above or below average time ~ (3 mins). The project contains:
* A Random Forest Classification Models that predicts delay times for the entire subway system. Built in Python, Jupyter Notebook, and with assistance from CHATGPT
* A step-by-step code that visualize some barcharts about occurences based on different categories (Delay occurrence based on Hour of the day, and Delay occurrence based on Day of the week)
