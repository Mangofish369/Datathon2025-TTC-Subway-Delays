# Datathon2025-TTC-Subway-Delays
Project: 00052 Improving Commuter Awareness in Subway Delays

A machine learning algorthim used to predict if TTC delay times will be above or below average time ~ (3 mins)
* Two Random Forest Classification Models built in Python, Jupyter Notebook with assistance from CHATGPT
* One predicts delay times for the entire subway system
* The second predicts delay times focusing on line 1 Yonge-University subways.
